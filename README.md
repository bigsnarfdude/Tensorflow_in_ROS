# Tensorflow_in_ROS
I made a ros-node to predict numbers from camera image.  
I used Tensorflow tutorial Deep MNIST model(https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html)

```
export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.12.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

sudo pip install â€“upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL
```




Before you use this, you must install some programs.

* Install Tensorflow (see https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html)  
* Install ROS (see http://wiki.ros.org)  
* Install OpenCV(see http://opencv.org/ or https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
* Install cv-bridge, and camera driver (for example, cv_camera)  

`$ sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-cv-bridge ros-indigo-cv-camera`

# tensorflow_in_ros_mnist.py
This is main file. This make the ros-node.

* publish: /result (std_msgs/Int16)
* subscribe: /image (sensor_msgs/Image)

# model.ckpt,model.ckpt.meta
This is Trained model.
Test set accuracy is approximately 99.2%.

# How to try

`$ roscore`  
`$ python tensorflow_in_ros_mnist.py image:=/cv_camera/image_raw`  
`$ rosrun cv_camera cv_camera_node`  
`$ rostopic echo /result`  

If you execute this code after launching a camera-node, this code will make error.  
But, it is ok because that is just "now loading" error and predict-code will be executed shortly after __init__-code finished.

# Result
You can see ros-node published predicted numbers. Look at this.  
Right picture is 9-image from camera.  
Left number is published predicted number.
